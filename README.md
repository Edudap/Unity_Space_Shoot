Hello Lisa and Jule!

My game is a standard space shooter in 2D
To move the spaceship you can use the arrowkey. The Spaceship moves from left to right and up and down. 
The main weapon is a laser, which we can shoot using the space bar. 

Enemy spaceships will spawn from the top of the screen. On the top left are the player's lives and on the top right the player's score. 

There are three power ups in the game. A shield, which protects the player from damage one time. A speed booster, which allow us to move faster. And a triple shot, which allows the ship to shoot three lasers at once. 

When the player takes damage, an animation shows the turbines on fire. When the player hits an enemy, an animation will show the enemy ship exploding. There is a song looping throughout the game. There are also explosion sound effects (: 

This game was made with the help of Udemy's official guide for developing games with Unity and with the book Unity in action. 

I hope you enjoy my silly game and thank you for taking the time to read this, it was very fun to learn how to use Unity. 
And thanks again Lisa for helping me with the Repository!
